## Example Configuration
You can setup your services in `sites.txt` at the root of the project.:
```txt
# Format: ServiceName=ServiceURL

GitHub=https://github.com
OpenAI=https://openai.com
Vercel=https://vercel.com
Netlify=https://netlify.com
AWS=https://aws.amazon.com
```

# Installation

## Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

The fastest way to get Quick Status running:

```bash
# Option 1: Build and run directly from GitHub
docker build -t quick-status https://github.com/dewstouh/quick-status.git#main:docker/images/quick-status
docker run -p 3000:3000 quick-status

# Option 2: Clone and use docker-compose
git clone https://github.com/dewstouh/quick-status.git
cd quick-status/docker/images/quick-status
docker compose up
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see your status page!

## Using Git (Development)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dewstouh/quick-status.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Building for Production

## Testing Workflows Locally
I personally use `act` to test the workflows locally. You can install it using:

```bash
brew install act
```

And then just start the workflow with:
```bash
act
```

# How it works
Quick Status monitors the services listed in `sites.txt` by checking their availability and response time every 30s or every refresh.

# API Documentation

Quick Status provides a comprehensive REST API for programmatically managing services and outages. The API allows you to:

- **Manage Services**: Create, read, update, and delete monitored services
- **Track Outages**: Create and manage service outages and incidents  
- **Monitor Status**: Get real-time service status and uptime information
- **Access History**: Retrieve historical outage data and service metrics

# History behind Quick Status
Quick Status was created out of a need for a simple, lightweight status page solution for **[Quickfra](https://quickfra.com)** that could be set up quickly and easily. Many existing solutions were either too complex or bloated with features that weren't necessary for the use case. Quick Status aims to provide a straightforward, no-frills status page that can be deployed in seconds and be configured with minimal effort.
